#### About git 
1. commit/push often, to not be alteration scared :
	1. notation : 17/20
	1. commentary  
		I've ofen push commit. However sometime i forgot to push.
1. use commit messages who describe changes and almost the alteration reason.
	1. notation : 14/20
	1. commentary :  
		When it's to fix an bug, the cause of commit are describe.  
		When it's an urgent patch, i think i forget to well comment because it's concern only one person.  
1. use English messages
	1. notation : 19/20
	1. commentary : Except when i don't see this rule. I apply it all the time. 
1. Don't commit generated files (use .gitignore so that git status are clean:
	1. notation : 18/20
	1. commentary :  
		I think i do well. I think we can criticize in fac we aren't perfect. Bu when it's necessarly i use that "Latest commit e0f75a6 on 24 Sep 2020 "
1. write needed doc in markdown (.md) for an good display in github.
	1. notation : 20/20
	1. commentary : I already try to do well that ^^

#### About your code

1. Write code in English : 
	1. notation : 20/20
	1. commentary : Except when i don't see this rule. I apply it all the time. 
1. indent / format your code correctly
	1. notation : 15/20
	1. commentary : I use ctrl+shift+f in Eclipse to auto indent. I try to follow this rule at start, but clearly with lot of projects, my mind deep in space. 
1. do not mix spaces and tabs (ideally, do not use tabs)
	1. notation : 10/20
	1. commentary : i try again... more in deep space. 
1. keep your code clean: no global/static variables, choose names correctly (packages, classes, etc), follow conventions (e.g., java convention), use constants for constant values:
	1. notation : 15/20
	1. commentary : 
		1. no global/static variables : Yes
		1. Name correctly : Must be Yes
		1. Follow convention : Must be yes
		1. Constant values : No
#### You writing software so :

1. test a lot and often
	1. notation : 16/20
	1. commentary :  We haven't time to test more, but practice test are done with me and Jeremy. Use of Jenkins can't possible with leak of time. 
1. automate tests that can be automated
	1. notation : 0/20
	1. commentary : Save time for other project (who we haven't finish... (TT) ) ! 
1. document how to use, compile, test and launch your project
	1. notation : 15/20
	1. commentary : I done that right now.
1. document how to understand and take over your project
	1. notation : 15/20
