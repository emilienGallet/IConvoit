1. use commit messages who describe changes and almost the alteration reason.
	1. notation : 14/20
	1. commentary :  
		When it's to fix an bug, the cause of commit are describe.

	1. notation : 20/20

	1. notation : 15/20

1. do not mix spaces and tabs (ideally, do not use tabs)
	1. notation : 10/20
	1. commentary : i try again... more in deep space.
